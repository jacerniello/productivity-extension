## A simple productivity extension meant to block and add usage timers to distracting websites
<br>
Goal statement:

Ever find yourself scrolling social media or the news when you know you should be working? 
I had the same issue, and other extensions were'nt working for me because they either 1) didn't block the sites effectively, 2) required payment, or 3) made me want to delete them.

The solution? A bare-bones productivity extension that blocks websites with timers for self-allocated breaks. 
This tool lets you be productive when you want and removes the itch to read the news every ten minutes.

Installation steps:

1) Go to Code > Download ZIP and extract the "extension" folder.
2) Drag and drop the extension folder into a chrome://extensions window with "Developer mode" turned on

Usage:
- Clicking on the extension will open a popup.
- Websites can be added via the "Enter domain" input and the "Add" button. There's a "remove" button next to each domain to delete the restriction.
- There's an option to set timers on websites you want to be on. "Set Timer" opens an input for this, and a countdown will appear after the timer begins.
